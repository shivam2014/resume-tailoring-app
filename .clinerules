Guide Management

1. Check/Create Guides First
if (!exists(PROJECT_GUIDE.md || CONTEXT_GUIDE.md)) create:

CONTEXT_GUIDE.md:
# Context Guide
- Project State (status, features, issues)
- Next Steps (plans, updates)
- Decisions (YYYY-MM-DD: what, why, impact)

PROJECT_GUIDE.md:
# Project Guide
- Config (tech, deps, setup)
- Standards (code, practices, structure)
- Architecture (design, components)

2. Update Requirements

CONTEXT_GUIDE.md:
- Task: state, issues, plans
- Dev: progress, decisions
- End: changes, status, next

PROJECT_GUIDE.md:
- Architecture: design, components
- Standards: patterns, rules
- Process: build, test, deploy

3. Usage
- Check before work
- Update during changes
- Keep current
- Track decisions

Always check/update guides to maintain context.
