# Context Guide

## Project State
- Status: Phase 3 (Validation) in progress
- Features:
  - HTML preview endpoint implementation
  - Error handling for HTML generation
  - Integration tests for HTML preview
  - PDF generation using pdfmake
  - AST-based LaTeX parsing
  - AST-to-legacy format adapter
  - Robust LaTeX text extraction
  - Section extraction with AST parsing
  - JSON parsing with validation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Resource leak prevention
  - Form validation with visual feedback only after submission
  - Code coverage reporting with search and navigation features
- Issues: 
  - ✓ Fixed: Missing field validation in streamAnalyzeJob causing runtime errors
  - ✓ Added comprehensive field validation with detailed error messages
  - ✓ Fixed: Testing compatibility issues with ESM/CommonJS module formats
  - ✓ Fixed: Function redeclaration error in main.js causing "Uncaught SyntaxError"
  - ✓ Fixed: Form validation showing errors on initial page load
  - ✓ Implemented code coverage reports with interactive search and navigation

## Next Steps
1. Fix failing tests in MistralHelper for malformed JSON responses
2. Maintain section comparison logic
3. Preserve CSS class names for diffs
4. ✓ Implemented field validation in streamAnalyzeJob function
5. ✓ Standardized test configuration to prevent ESM/CommonJS conflicts
6. ✓ Added comprehensive form validation with visual feedback
7. ✓ Added unit tests for form validation
8. ✓ Fixed function redeclaration of showError and resetUI in main.js
9. ✓ Fixed form validation to only show errors after submission attempt
10. ✓ Implemented test coverage reporting with search and keyboard navigation

## Decisions
2025-03-14: Removed pdflatex and LaTeX.js dependencies
- Why: To migrate to pdfmake for better maintainability and cross-platform compatibility
- Impact: Simplified PDF generation process, removed external dependencies

2025-03-14: Implemented AST-based LaTeX parsing
- Why: To replace regex-based parsing with more robust solution
- Impact: Improved accuracy and maintainability of LaTeX parsing

2025-03-15: Enhanced JSON parsing and error handling
- Why: To improve reliability of streaming data processing
- Impact: Better error recovery and fallback mechanisms

2025-03-15: Fixed resource leaks in test suite
- Why: To ensure proper cleanup of resources during testing
- Impact: More reliable test execution and reduced memory usage

2025-03-16: Enhanced input validation in streamAnalyzeJob
- Why: To prevent "Missing required fields" errors during streaming analysis
- Impact: More robust error handling and improved user experience with clearer error messages

2025-03-17: Implemented comprehensive field validation
- Why: To prevent "Missing required fields" errors and improve error reporting
- Impact: More robust input validation with detailed error messages and test coverage

2025-03-17: Standardized test configuration
- Why: To prevent CommonJS/ESM compatibility issues when adding new tests
- Impact: Simplified test development process with clear guidelines and centralized configuration

2025-03-19: Implemented dual export pattern for validation functions
- Why: To enable direct testing of validation functions while maintaining class-based API
- Impact: Improved testability with standalone functions that can be imported directly in test files

2025-03-19: Standardized validation across module formats
- Why: To ensure consistent behavior between ESM and CommonJS versions
- Impact: Unified validation logic with identical field requirements across all implementations

2025-03-19: Implemented UI validation feedback
- Why: To provide clear visual indicators when form inputs are invalid
- Impact: Improved user experience with inline validation messages and styling

2025-03-19: Added form validation test suite
- Why: To ensure validation logic functions correctly across application updates
- Impact: Improved test coverage and detection of validation regression issues

2025-03-20: Fixed function redeclaration issues in main.js
- Why: To resolve JavaScript SyntaxError caused by duplicate function declarations
- Impact: Improved code maintainability and eliminated runtime errors

2025-03-20: Improved form validation UX
- Why: To prevent premature validation errors on empty fields before submission
- Impact: Better user experience with validation errors only appearing after form submission attempt
